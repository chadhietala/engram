# Read Bash Pattern 1

## Overview

Use this skill when you need to understand unfamiliar architectures, meta-cognitive systems, or abstract reasoning frameworks. Begin by reading core theoretical components and architectural patterns to build a mental model of the system's design principles. Once the underlying abstractions are internalized, transition to active development that extends or operationalizes those patterns into concrete implementations.

## When to Use

- Working with unfamiliar cognitive architectures or reasoning systems
- Exploring codebases with abstract theoretical patterns before making changes
- Understanding meta-cognitive frameworks like memory systems, dialectic reasoning, or knowledge processing
- Building extensions to complex systems where architectural alignment is critical
- Transitioning from theoretical understanding to practical implementation in sophisticated domains

## Steps

1. **Follow the pattern described above**
   When working with complex cognitive or meta-cognitive systems, begin with comprehensive architectural exploration to understand theoretical patterns and abstractions, then transition to active develop

## Edge Cases

### When conditions differ

The thesis asserts the user is "comprehensively exploring" the engram codebase to understand its memory/knowledge architecture and dialectical reasoning. However, the contradicting evidence shows the user is actually **building and generating** rather than just exploring. Specifically, they're reading `/src/skill-generator/script-generator.ts` - a code generation tool that transforms captured procedural patterns into executable Bun scripts. This is active development work on the skill generation pipeline itself, not passive exploration of how memory encoding works. The context further contradicts the exploration thesis by revealing the user is in the midst of a database schema migration (from denormalized to normalized many-to-many relationships) and examining `.claude/skills/build-metacognitive/script.ts` - an auto-generated skill script. These actions indicate the user is refactoring and improving engram's skill generation infrastructure, not studying its theoretical architecture. (Resolution hint: The thesis and evidence represent different phases of the same meta-cognitive development cycle. The user likely **began** with comprehensive exploration (understanding dialectical reasoning, memory encoding) and has now **transitioned** to active development (improving the skill generator that operationalizes those patterns). The "exploration" phase focused on engram's theoretical knowledge processing architecture, while the current "development" phase focuses on making that architecture generate better executable skills. This is recursive self-improvement: understanding how engram learns patterns, then improving how it transforms those learned patterns into reusable skills. Both modes serve the same ultimate goal - just at different layers of abstraction.)
