# Build Metacognitive

## Overview

This skill guides you through a two-phase process: first, the Bootstrap Phase where you explicitly direct the AI to construct synthesis databases, pattern extraction pipelines, and skill generation logic; second, the Autonomous Phase where the completed infrastructure allows the AI to observe its own behavior and self-improve. Use imperative commands during bootstrap ("Create a synthesis table", "Build pattern extraction") and then transition to observational mode once the system is operational.

## When to Use

- Building AI systems that need to learn from their own execution patterns
- Creating metacognitive infrastructure for AI agents
- Developing self-improving tools that start with human guidance but evolve to autonomy
- Resolving the apparent contradiction between directed development and autonomous learning
- Implementing systems that extract patterns from their own tool usage sequences

## Steps

1. **Follow the pattern described above**
   Recursive self-improvement systems must pass through two distinct phases: a **Bootstrap Phase** where humans direct the AI to construct the metacognitive infrastructure (synthesis databases, pattern e

## Edge Cases

### When conditions differ

The thesis describes a system where the AI autonomously observes, synthesizes patterns, and generates skills automatically. However, the contradicting evidence shows the AI performing manual, human-directed code edits to the dialectic synthesis database schema - specifically editing `createSynthesis` function in the dialectic.ts file. 

This contradicts the thesis because instead of the AI autonomously extracting patterns and generating skills, the AI is acting as a traditional code editor, making specific file modifications at the user's direction. The AI is the *tool being used* rather than the autonomous agent *using tools and learning from them*. The evidence shows manual refactoring of the infrastructure that would enable the self-improvement system, not the self-improvement system actually running.

In essence: the thesis describes the AI as the autonomous learner/actor, but the evidence shows the AI as the passive instrument being directed by a human to build that learning infrastructure. (Resolution hint: These can be reconciled by recognizing distinct phases: (1) Bootstrap/Construction Phase - where humans direct the AI to build the dialectic synthesis infrastructure through manual edits, and (2) Autonomous Operation Phase - where the completed system enables the AI to observe its own tool usage and self-improve. The contradiction reveals we're observing the construction phase, not the operational phase. The manual edits to dialectic.ts are building the very machinery (synthesis database, pattern extraction) that would later enable autonomous self-improvement. The thesis describes the intended end-state, while the evidence captures the scaffolding phase required to reach it.)
