# Analyze Complex

## Overview

Use this skill when encountering unfamiliar or complex system architectures that require deep understanding before modification. The skill performs comprehensive file reading across theoretical components, processing layers, and implementation patterns to build a mental model of how the system operates. Once the architecture is internalized, transition to active development with confidence in how new changes will integrate with existing abstractions.

## When to Use

- Working with unfamiliar codebases that have complex theoretical foundations or cognitive architectures
- Before implementing features in systems with intricate abstractions that need to be understood holistically
- When exploring meta-cognitive systems, reasoning engines, or AI architectures where understanding the theory-to-implementation mapping is critical
- Prior to refactoring or extending systems where changes could have cascading effects across architectural layers

## Steps

1. **Follow the pattern described above**
   When working with complex cognitive or meta-cognitive systems, begin with comprehensive architectural exploration to understand theoretical patterns and abstractions, then transition to active develop

## Edge Cases

### When conditions differ

The thesis asserts the user is "comprehensively exploring" the engram codebase to understand its memory/knowledge architecture and dialectical reasoning. However, the contradicting evidence shows the user is actually **building and generating** rather than just exploring. Specifically, they're reading `/src/skill-generator/script-generator.ts` - a code generation tool that transforms captured procedural patterns into executable Bun scripts. This is active development work on the skill generation pipeline itself, not passive exploration of how memory encoding works. The context further contradicts the exploration thesis by revealing the user is in the midst of a database schema migration (from denormalized to normalized many-to-many relationships) and examining `.claude/skills/build-metacognitive/script.ts` - an auto-generated skill script. These actions indicate the user is refactoring and improving engram's skill generation infrastructure, not studying its theoretical architecture. (Resolution hint: The thesis and evidence represent different phases of the same meta-cognitive development cycle. The user likely **began** with comprehensive exploration (understanding dialectical reasoning, memory encoding) and has now **transitioned** to active development (improving the skill generator that operationalizes those patterns). The "exploration" phase focused on engram's theoretical knowledge processing architecture, while the current "development" phase focuses on making that architecture generate better executable skills. This is recursive self-improvement: understanding how engram learns patterns, then improving how it transforms those learned patterns into reusable skills. Both modes serve the same ultimate goal - just at different layers of abstraction.)
